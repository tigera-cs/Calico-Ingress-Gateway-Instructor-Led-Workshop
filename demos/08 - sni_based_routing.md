### Welcome!

Welcome to the **Calico Ingress Gateway Instructor Led Workshop**. 

The Calico Ingress Gateway Workshop aims to explain the kubernetes' and IngressAPI native limitations, the differences between IngressAPI and GatewayAPI and the most common use cases where Calico Ingress Gateway can solve.

We hope you enjoyed the presentation! Feel free to download the slides:

### Overview

In multi-tenant or multi-domain environments, a single ingress point often needs to serve multiple TLS-secured applications, each with its own domain and certificate (e.g., `www.example.com` and `www.sample.com`). Server Name Indication (SNI) in TLS allows the server to choose the correct certificate based on the hostname requested by the client during the handshake.

Envoy Gateway supports SNI-based TLS routing using the Kubernetes Gateway API with Gateway and TLSRoute resources. You can associate different TLS certificates with different hostnames, and Envoy will automatically select the appropriate certificate during the TLS handshake using SNI. This enables secure, multi-domain ingress with clean separation and centralized managementâ€”all declaratively configured in Kubernetes.

### High Level Tasks

- Create a ServiceAccount, a Service and a Deployment for the `backend-sni` application
- Create a Gateway resource
- Create an HTTPRoute `backend-sni` which routes traffic to the `backend-sni` service
- Retrieve the external IP of the Envoy Gateway and **test** with no certificate
- Generate self-signed RSA derived Server certificate and private key, and configure those in the Gateway listener configuration to terminate HTTPS traffic for `example.com`
- Update the Gateway to include an HTTPS listener that listens on port 443 and references the `example-cert` Secret
- Query the example app through the Gateway on port 443 and validate the server's certificate using `example.com.crt`
- Generate self-signed RSA derived Server certificate and private key, and configure those in the Gateway listener configuration to terminate HTTPS traffic for `sample.com`
- Update the Gateway configuration to accommodate the new Certificate which will be used to Terminate TLS traffic for `www.sample.com`
- Patch the HTTPRoute to include `www.sample.com` and **test** both `www.example.com` and `www.sample.com`

### Demo

This sections gives a walkthrough to generate multiple certificates corresponding to different FQDNs. The same Gateway listener can then be configured to terminate TLS traffic for multiple FQDNs based on the SNI matching.

#### 1. Create a `ServiceAccount`, a `Service` and a `Deployment` for the `backend-sni` application

  ```
  cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ServiceAccount
  metadata:
    name: backend-sni
  ---
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: backend-sni
    labels:
      app: backend-sni
      service: backend-sni
  spec:
    ports:
      - name: http
        port: 3000
        targetPort: 3000
    selector:
      app: backend-sni
  ---
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: backend-sni
  spec:
    replicas: 1
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: backend-sni
        version: v1
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: backend-sni
          version: v1
      spec:
        serviceAccountName: backend-sni
        containers:
          - image: gcr.io/k8s-staging-gateway-api/echo-basic:v20231214-v1.0.0-140-gf544a46e
            imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
            name: backend-sni
            ports:
              - containerPort: 3000
            env:
              - name: POD_NAME
                valueFrom:
                  fieldRef:
                    fieldPath: metadata.name
              - name: NAMESPACE
                valueFrom:
                  fieldRef:
                    fieldPath: metadata.namespace
  EOF
  ```

#### 2. Create a Gateway resource named "sni-gateway" using the "tigera-gateway-class".

  ```
  kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
  apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Gateway
  metadata:
    name: sni-gateway
  spec:
    gatewayClassName: tigera-gateway-class
    listeners:
      - name: http
        protocol: HTTP
        port: 80
  EOF
  ```

#### 3. Create an HTTPRoute `backend-sni` which routes traffic to the `backend-sni` service:
  ```
  kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
  apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
  kind: HTTPRoute
  metadata:
    name: backend-sni
  spec:
    parentRefs:
      - name: sni-gateway
    hostnames:
      - "www.example.com"
    rules:
      - backendRefs:
          - group: ""
            kind: Service
            name: backend-sni
            port: 3000
            weight: 1
        matches:
          - path:
              type: PathPrefix
              value: /
  EOF
  ```

#### 4. Wait for 30 seconds to allow services and gateway to be ready

  ```
  sleep 30
  ```

#### 5. Retrieve the external IP of the Envoy Gateway

  ```
  export GATEWAY_SNI_DEMO=$(kubectl get gateway/sni-gateway -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
  echo "GATEWAY_SNI_DEMO is: $GATEWAY_SNI_DEMO"
  ```

#### 6. Test with no certificate

From the bastion, send a request to the gateway and get a response as shown below:

  ```
  curl --verbose --header "Host: www.example.com" http://$GATEWAY_SNI_DEMO/get
  ```

   A `200` status code should be returned and the body should include `"pod": "backend-sni-*"` indicating the traffic was routed to the example `backend-sni` service. Sample of output:

  ```
  *   Trying 10.10.10.22:80...
  * TCP_NODELAY set
  * Connected to 10.10.10.22 (10.10.10.22) port 80 (#0)

  "method": "GET",
  "proto": "HTTP/1.1",

  "service": "",
  "pod": "backend-sni-74bdbf5d5f-qh227"
  * Connection #0 to host 10.10.10.22 left intact
  ```

#### 7. Generate self-signed RSA derived Server certificate and private key, and configure those in the Gateway listener configuration to terminate HTTPS traffic for `example.com`

  ```
  openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -subj '/O=example Inc./CN=example.com' -keyout example.com.key -out example.com.crt
  openssl req -out www.example.com.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout www.example.com.key -subj "/CN=www.example.com/O=example organization"
  openssl x509 -req -days 365 -CA example.com.crt -CAkey example.com.key -set_serial 0 -in www.example.com.csr -out www.example.com.crt
  kubectl create secret tls example-cert --key=www.example.com.key --cert=www.example.com.crt
  ```

#### 8. Update the Gateway to include an HTTPS listener that listens on port `443` and references the `example-cert` `Secret`:

  ```
  kubectl patch gateway sni-gateway --type=json --patch '
    - op: add
      path: /spec/listeners/-
      value:
        name: https
        protocol: HTTPS
        port: 443
        tls:
          mode: Terminate
          certificateRefs:
          - kind: Secret
            group: ""
            name: example-cert
    '
  ```
#### 9. Query the example app through the Gateway on port 443 and validate the server's certificate using `example.com.crt`

  ```
  curl -v -HHost:www.example.com --resolve "www.example.com:443:${GATEWAY_SNI_DEMO}" \
--cacert example.com.crt https://www.example.com/get
  ```

  The output should show `200` response and `SSL certificate verify ok`. Sample of output:

  ```
  * Added www.example.com:443:10.10.10.22 to DNS cache
  * Hostname www.example.com was found in DNS cache
  *   Trying 10.10.10.22:443...
  * TCP_NODELAY set
  * Connected to www.example.com (10.10.10.22) port 443 (#0)

  ```

#### 10. Generate self-signed RSA derived Server certificate and private key, and configure those in the Gateway listener configuration to terminate HTTPS traffic for `sample.com`

Note that all occurrences of `example.com` were just replaced with `sample.com`.

  ```
  openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -subj '/O=sample Inc./CN=sample.com' -keyout sample.com.key -out sample.com.crt
  openssl req -out www.sample.com.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout www.sample.com.key -subj "/CN=www.sample.com/O=sample organization"
  openssl x509 -req -days 365 -CA sample.com.crt -CAkey sample.com.key -set_serial 0 -in www.sample.com.csr -out www.sample.com.crt
  kubectl create secret tls sample-cert --key=www.sample.com.key --cert=www.sample.com.crt
  ```

#### 11. Update the Gateway configuration to accommodate the new Certificate which will be used to Terminate TLS traffic for `www.sample.com`:

  ```
  kubectl patch gateway sni-gateway --type=json --patch '
    - op: add
      path: /spec/listeners/1/tls/certificateRefs/-
      value:
        name: sample-cert
    '
  ```

#### 12. Patch the `HTTPRoute` to include `www.sample.com`:

  ```
  kubectl patch httproute backend-sni --type=json --patch '
    - op: add
      path: /spec/hostnames/-
      value: www.sample.com
    '
  ```

#### 13. Query the backend-sni application through the gateway for `www.example.com`:

  ```
  curl -v -HHost:www.example.com --resolve "www.example.com:443:${GATEWAY_SNI_DEMO}" \
--cacert example.com.crt https://www.example.com/get -I
  ```

  You should have received the same result as before.

#### 14. Query the same backend-sni application through the same gateway for `www.sample.com` instead:

  ```
  curl -v -HHost:www.sample.com --resolve "www.sample.com:443:${GATEWAY_SNI_DEMO}" \
--cacert sample.com.crt https://www.sample.com/get -I
  ```

  The output should show `200` response and `SSL certificate verify ok`. Sample of output:
  ```
  > --cacert sample.com.crt https://www.sample.com/get -I
  * Added www.sample.com:443:10.10.10.22 to DNS cache
  * Hostname www.sample.com was found in DNS cache
  *   Trying 10.10.10.22:443...
  * TCP_NODELAY set
  * Connected to www.sample.com (10.10.10.22) port 443 (#0)
